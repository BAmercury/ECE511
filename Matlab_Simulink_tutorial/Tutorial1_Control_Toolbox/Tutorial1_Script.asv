% Matlab allows us to define polynomials as vectors
Ds = [1 3 4 10]; % Where coefficients entered are in descending order
% We can find roots of polynomials using roots
roots(Ds)
% Make sure you add zero place holders for polynomials that don't have 
% coefficients listed for some less powers

From the control systems toolbox, we can generate objects
which represent transfer functions (tf)
